# Smart-Mitigation-Railway-System

This is one of the freelance projects I worked on, focused on developing a railway mitigation system for accident prevention. The system uses two Arduino boardsâ€”one placed on the train to handle obstacle avoidance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and another on the platform to control the railway crossing gates, signals, and a smart platform-to-platform bridge. The smart bridge is a novel concept designed to ease passenger movement between platforms when the train is stationary, improving safety and convenience. IR sensors are used to detect the presence of the train and automate the railway crossing gates accordingly. This integrated system aims to enhance both commuter safety and railway operational efficiency.
